This is a minimal example of using WebRTC for peer-to-peer communication. It demonstrates how to establish a connection between two peers and exchange messages.

You can run this example with the following steps:

```
# 1. Install Bun
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
# or `nix-shell` if you have Nix installed

# 2. Install dependencies
bun install

# 3. Build the project
bun run build

# 4. Start the server
bun start
```
